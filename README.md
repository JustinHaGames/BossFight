## Objective
Multiplayer _coopetition_ game where all players work together to defeat 1 Boss, but only the player to land the killing blow wins!

## Setup
To play Boss Fight(WIP) you need 3 types of pieces.
1. **Avatar** - this is you for all intents and purposes and you will gain health, build up your attack, and hopefully defeat the man. (yup, I just decided this game is about overthrowing _the man_)
2. **Rune** - think of this as a magical token. It is avaiable each turn to give health or stockpile weapons. (do you want XP or HP?)
3. **Boss** - this wouldn't be very exciting without _the man_ to defeat. The boss shows its health at all times and takes damage from players hits. The boss heals every round, so you'll have to be swift in the killing.

## Gameplay

### Actions
Players can perform 1 action on their turn

- **Attack** the Boss
- **Stockpile** and gain 1 more attack for your next turn
- **Gift** another player (same as stockpiling, but for someone else)
- **Heal**
  - yourself **-OR-**
  - another player **-OR-**
  - the Boss (even _the man_ gets some chicken noodle soup sometimes)

### Rounds

Once every player has had their turn, all 4 players will attach themselves to the Boss and click the Boss. 

The Boss will either give itself 1 health or deal damage to all players equal to its health.
